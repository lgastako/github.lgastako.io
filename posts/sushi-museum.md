# Your Production Code Should Be a Sushi Museum

(~~even~~*especially* in a startup)

My titular assertion might seem a controversial claim to some, given the
proliferation of ideas like "perfect is the enemy of good" in programming these
days.

> Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.

Lack of sushi museums experience may leave others reluctant to accept my claim
without further argumentation, so argue I will.
