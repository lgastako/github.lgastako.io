# play doh sofware development

ok maybe more like kids toys in general but just within play doh there are many
instructive examples like hardening and becoming brittle if left alone, usually
regretting that if your goal is to have an ongoing concern, you can harden the
play doh if it will help, but it's sort of irreverisble, you can upgrade to
better toys for the job (lincoln logs = erlang or capsela = clojure, haskell =
erector?)
